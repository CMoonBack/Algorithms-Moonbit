# KMP

 KMP algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm, and the main use scenario of this algorithm is to locate the pattern string (also called substring) in the string (also called the main string), and the common ones are "find the starting position of the occurrence of the substring", "find the number of occurrences of the substring", etc.

 Here, the KMP algorithm I give is to find the subscript that occurs in each substring and return it as an Array
